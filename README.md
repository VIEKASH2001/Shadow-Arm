# Shadow-Arm
路 Fabricated and programmed a 2 DoF writing robotic arm using ATmega 328p microcontroller and two Servo motors. 路 With the help of Image Processing (Contour detection), object movement in front of the camera is tracked down and the path of movement (points) is got from the objects centroid which is calculated. 路 Used PySerial to communicate between python (opencv) and Arduino IDE. 路 A 2 joint, 2 link system was created and inverse kinematic solutions to points within the arms were implemented.
