# Shadow-Arm
Demonstration Video Link: https://youtu.be/iAxC_sOx8i8

Shadow Arm is a 2 Degree of Freedom (DoF) writing robotic arm that I fabricated and programmed using an ATmega 328p microcontroller and two servo motors. The arm is able to track object movement in front of a camera using contour detection, and obtain the path of movement through calculating the centroid of the object.

To facilitate communication between Python (OpenCV) and the Arduino IDE, I used PySerial. In addition, I created a 2 joint, 2 link system and implemented inverse kinematic solutions to points within the arms.

This project was a challenging yet rewarding experience, and I hope that you find it as interesting as I did. Thank you for visiting my page!
